            <p>For more than a decade, the Amazing Computing magazine connected Amiga computer users to news, advice, and community. Since the magazine went defunct, loyal readers and computer lovers have worked to maintain an archive of the magazine. This website features scanned copies of every issue of Amazing Computing, giving modern Amiga enthusiasts a chance to explore this piece of 90s computer culture. </p>
