            <p>PiM Publications, Inc. was a Fall River publisher founded in 1986. Among its other publications, it printed and distributed <em>Amazing Computing Magazine</em> from about 1985 to 1999. Though PiM was noted for its publication of<em>Amazing Computing</em> and two other Amiga-related magazines, <em>AC's Tech</em> and <em>AC's Guide</em>, they were forced to dissolve the publisher in 2007. </p> 
            <p>Though the magazine no longer runs and Amiga computers are no longer being produced, the magazine's dedicated fanbase has created several archives over the years. Two of these inspired this project and archive, Jason Scott of <a href="https://archive.org/details/amazing-computing-magazine" target="_blank">the Internet Archive</a> and <a href="http://www.youngmonkey.ca/nose/magazines/AmazingComputing.html">young monkey</a>, also known as Dhomas Trenn.</p>
